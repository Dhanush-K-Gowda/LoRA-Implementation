This repository implements **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)**, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique for neural networks. LoRA allows fine-tuning large models by introducing low-rank updates to specific layers, significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters while maintaining performance.

For more details, refer to the [LoRA Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685).
